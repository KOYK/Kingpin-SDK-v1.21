There are a few maps provided. 
You will need KPradiant that comes on the Kingpin CD to use
these files.

Each map is provided for a different purpose:

bar_sy.map: how to build a bar level.

rival_teams.map: how to build a teamplay or deathmatch
level.

rtpv20.map: an unfinished example motorcycle level. You will
need to type "g_vehicle_test 3" before starting this level.
Keep in mind that the motorcycles are very rough and unfinished.
We decided to keep them in there, incase some mod authors wanted
to make a motorcycle-based mod, this gives you a head-start.

sr1.map: the first playable level in the game, this map shows
how to build a single player level, with various characters
assigned to different gangs, AI moral levels, etc.
